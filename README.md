# An example of simple app made on ReactJS

## Description
App can add user data to the table with validation and sort values by column

## How to use
The app uses an in-browser JSX Transformer, therefore, the code cannot be run without a web server (or your browser will complain that "Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP").

```bash
npm install
npm start
http-server
```

And now view at: http://localhost:8080/.
